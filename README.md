# MERN_stack_website

The goal of this project is to build a portfolio website on a MERN stack and HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript. The portfolio build process will follow the work outlined in the video [Build and Deploy a Fullstack Responsive Portfolio Website | ULTIMATE Step By Step Tutorial 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HNyXCPDQ7Q)

## What will you learn?

- React functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- SCSS and Flex
- Animations using Framer Motion
- Sanity content platform (allows us to manage the content through the entire creation process)

## Knowledge

- **MVC** (Model, view, controller): This is a concept/design pattern of interactions that simplifies an app down to 3 components; the model, the view, and the controller. The goal to separate functionality, logic and the UI of an application.  
  And example is below:
    Model -> Database backend (the brain)
    View -> front-end (the 5 senses)
    controller -> server (the body)


## Tips

- Start Sanity by navigating to the `backend_sanity` folder and running `santiy start`
