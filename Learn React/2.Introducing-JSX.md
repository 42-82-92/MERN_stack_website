# JSX

JSX (aka, JavaScript XML) is Java language syntax that allows developers to write code in what looks like HTML. Note: JSX uses camelCase naming convention instead of HTML attribute names. 

EX

``` jsx
const App = () => {
   return (
     <div>
       <p>Header</p>
       <p>Content</p>
       <p>Footer</p>
     </div>
   ); 
}
```

or

``` jsx
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
```

You can put anything in those {} and it will be treated as a Java Script expression. As a result, you can use JSX inside of `if` and `for`  loops. EX:

``` jsx
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
```

However, don't use curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. Use either quotes for string values, or curly braces for expressions, but __not both in the same attribute__! 

Mixing scripting and HTML sounds like an easy target for cross site scripting attacks. Fortunately, React DOM escapes and stringify all code before rendering. That way nothing is injected unless it's explicitly in your application.
